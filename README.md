I am Tom Sullivan

I am based in Kelmscott, Perth, Western Australia.

I do solo programming and learning in currently the C programming language and formerly Java. I have ambitions of possibly learning the C++ programming language, the C# programming language, and many more.

I am highly interested in AI/Machine Learning Development.

I could talk for hours about development and Machine Learning and lots of other subjects such as music or games or movies. I am very obsessed with Bj√∂rk, the Icelandic singer and songwriter; she is very pretty and uses smart, conventional tactics with her music making.

I have a goal to land a professional AI/Machine Learning job. Currently, this might change as I am fluidly thinking about which job I do want to land in the near future. I want to be proud of myself and to make others feel mutually the same.

I am 14 years old and I am very ambitious to achieve goals and conquer mountainous terrains.
