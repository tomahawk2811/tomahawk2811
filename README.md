I'm Tom Sullivan, a 14-year-old solo programmer based in Kelmscott, Perth, Western Australia. Currently into the C programming language, 
I have previously also used Java and have ambitions to master languages like C++ and C#.

My interests revolve around AI/Machine Learning Development and I can chat for hours about development, machine learning, or dive into topics like music, games, and movies. I am particularly infatuated with Bj√∂rk, the Icelandic singer and songwriter, 
admiring her beauty and the smart, unconventional tactics she employs in her music.

I have a goal to land a professional AI/Machine Learning job, my career path is a dynamic journey as I explore various opportunities. 
My Aim: to be proud of my accomplishments and create a mutual sense of pride in others.

My ambition fuels my drive to achieve goals and conquer challenging terrains. 

I am a firm believer in the power of knowledge-sharing within the tech community. Networking and building connections play a crucial role in my journey, as shown from my active presence on LinkedIn. I allow opportunities for engaging discussions, collaborative projects, helping/developing open-source projects, or simply connecting with individuals who share a passion for AI, machine learning, and the ever-evolving world of technology. 

I am excited about the unfolding chapters of my life. Whether i could be delving deeper into machine learning algorithms, exploring new programming languages, or merging my passion for technology with other creative pursuits, I approach each endeavor with an open mind and a hunger for knowledge. As I continue to evolve as a programmer and an individual, I am committed to leaving a positive outlook on the tech industry and inspiring others to embark on their own explorations within the vast world of technology and innovation.
